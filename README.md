**IvxApi**
------

This is a simple wrapper that uses the new library [ivx-api2-php](https://github.com/digfish/ivx-api2-php).


The two configuration constants IVX_DOMAIN and IVX_TOKEN are stored in the ivx/ivx_config.php file . Replace the two values with your own.
In the [ivx-api2-php] project there is instructions on how to obtain these values.
