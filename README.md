ivxApi


This is a simple wrapper that uses the other library InvoiceXpressRequest-PHP-API.
The class MyInvoiceXpressApi uses the cache implementation from laravel to store the metadata retrieved from the API.
So, in order to properly use this stuff, you have to download Laravel.
The two configuration constants IVX_DOMAIN and IVX_TOKEN are stored in the ivx/ivx_config.php file . Replace the two values with your own.
